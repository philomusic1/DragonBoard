This is my keyboard inspired by the Corne Split Keyboard

It is a 58 Key Keyboard, with 2 Rotary encoders which have their switches wired into the Keyboard Switches matrix so it can be used as 60% keyboard
It is designed to be compatible with the Nice!Nano v2 and niceview display (the display can be swapped out for a oled one)
It is a reverisble PCB, so you only needs to send 1 gerber to your PCB manufacturer saving on costs and making it easier
The case is an acrylic case with a display protecter added
It is designed to be a wireless Keyboard with cherry mx hotswap switches with Per key RGB using SK6812 mini-e
